Elsa Java Serialization
=======================

Java serialization alternative. 
It is faster and more space efficient alternative to `ObjectInputStream` and `ObjectOutputStream`.
Elsa tries to be compatible with Java Serialization. 
It supports `Externalizable` and `Serializable` interfaces, `writeReplace` methods and so on.

Elsa was originally part of [MapDB jar](http://www.mapdb), 
but was moved into separate library.
